## Dependencies

- Ubuntu System 18.04 or above
- Install Adb tool (Android debugging bridge) on host system
- Setup the QCS-610 Yocto build environment  
- valid amazon aws user account
- Install python 3.5 or above on the host system 

### **Note:** 
-  For python implementation, building on the yocto environment is not required ( will be necessary for c++ implementation).

## Prerequisites

- Setting up the Application SDK on the host system.
- Camera Environment configuration setup on the target device.
- Setting up aws-iot device on aws console
- Compiling the aws-iot-c++ sdk on yocto environment

### 1. Setting up the Application SDK on the host system:

 - To Install the Application SDK,  download the sdk using  url given in the section 2 of the below document 
  ```
    “[TC_C610LE_23110]_TurboX C610 OK_Application SDK User Manual_V1.0.pdf“.
  ```
    
  - After downloading, unpack the application sdk and  execute the below script file it will ask the default target directory, press enter and type 'Y'
    ```
    /# ./oecore-x86_64-armv7ahf-neon-toolchain-nodistro.0.sh
    ```

   - This complete the environment setup.


### 2. Camera Environment configuration setup on the target device.
   - To setup the camera environment configuration follow the given document ‘Turbox-C610_Open_Kit_Software_User_Manual_LE1.0_v2.0.pdf’ In given url 
    
 ```
  “https://www.thundercomm.com/app_en/product/1593776185472315” 
    
 ```
    and refer section 2.10.1

### 3. Setting up AWS-iot connect
  
  - To setup the aws-iot-connect refer the below link and inside the iot quick start document in step2, while creating the think object, select device as python instead of javascript.
```
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-quick-start.html  
```
Save the credentials to the certificates folder in the application directory.

### 4. Compiling the aws-iot-c++ sdk on yocto environment
**Step-1:** clone the git meta-aws repository to your host system
        
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/aws/meta-aws.git
        
 ```     
**Step-2:**  Copy the aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2 to yocto project environment  
         
  ```
 $ cp meta-aws-master/recipes-sdk/ <working directory>/poky/meta-aws/recipes-sdk/
 $ cd  <working directory> 
         
 ```

**Step- 3:**  Initialize the build environment

```
$ export  SHELL=/bin/bash
$ source poky/qti-conf/set_bb_env.sh
       
```  

 - Select “qcs610-odk meta-qti-bsp” from the available machines menu. On selecting the machine, the ncurses menu starts. Select “qti-distro-fullstack-perf meta-qti-bsp” from Available Distributions menu. The shell prompt will now move to the following build directory
 
```
<working directory>/build-qti-distro-fullstack-perf/$

```
     
 **Step-4:** Add the aws-meta path in bblayers.conf file in ‘<working directory>/build-qti-distro-fullstack-perf/conf/bblayers.conf ’ folder

 **Step -5:** run the bitbake command 
  ``` 
   $ bitbake  aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
  ```
- After running sucessfully this command, you can find the required compiled library as well as include folders generated in the path “<build_directory>/tmp-gibc/
sysroots-components/armv7ahf-neon/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/usr/”,

- Copy the lib/ directory to the application directory. 
  ```
    $ cp <build_directory>/tmp-gibc/sysroots-components/armv7ahf-neon/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/usr/lib    /home/user/iot_aws/.
  ```

**Step-6:** To compile application code use below bitbake command 
 ```     
   $ bitbake -c compile -f  aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
 ```
 
 **Step-7:** After successfully running the bitbake command you can find the git version of code is available in “<build_directory>/tmp-gibc/work/armv7ahf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/1.6.0-r0/” folder. 
 - Replace the current basic_pub_sub folder in path “git/samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub” with ‘basic_pub_sub’ folder given in our repository. 
 - Execute the bitbake command given in step-6, After the sucessfully execution, target binary will be generated in “build/samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/basic_pub_sub” folder      

 **Step-8:** Rename the binary ‘basic_pub_sub’ to ‘publish’ and copy to the application directory. Also copy the libcJSON.so file to lib folder in appication directory.      
    ```
     $ cp <build_directory>/tmp-gibc/work/armv7ahf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/1.6.0-r0/build/samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/publish  /home/user/iot_aws/.
 
      $ cp <build_directory>/tmp-gibc/work/armv7ahf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/1.6.0-r0/build/samples/mqtt/basic_pub_sub/libcJSON.so  /home/user/iot_aws/lib/.
    ```

## Steps to build the camera application: 

- Building the camera application:
 **Step-1:** Enter below command to set up the cross compilation environment on the host system.
  ```
   $ git clone <source repository>
   $ cp <source repository> /home/user/aws-iot/
   $ cd aws-iot 
   $ source /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7ahf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
  ```
  
 **Step-2:** Build the camera application binary using below command.                                       
   ```
   $ $CC video_record.c video_record.h -o videoaws `pkg-config --cflags --libs gstreamer-1.0`
   ```
   
 **Step-3:** Push the camera application binary to the target board with adb command.
  ```
      $ adb root 
      $ adb remount 
      $ adb shell  mount -o remount,rw /
      $ adb forward tcp:8900 tcp:8900
      $ adb push videoaws /data/aws-iot/
  ```

## Step for including aws cert-key files
   - Edit the publish.py and basic_pub_sub/main.cpp files in application directory to update the certificate details present in /home/user/aws-iot/certificates..
   - push the certificated to target board
   
   ``` 
   $ adb push certificates /data/aws-iot/
   ```
   
## Step for AWS Python IOT SDK Integration 

  -  push the aws-iot-python-sdk, and python source code to target board
  ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python.git
    $ cd aws-iot-device-sdk-python
    $ adb push  AWSIoTPythonSDK/  /data/aws-iot/
    $ cd ..
    $ adb  publish.py  /data/aws-iot/
  ```
 - push the json library folder to python 3.5 library folder on the target board
 ```
    $ adb push json/  /usr/lib/python3.5/

```

## Step for AWS IOT c++ sdk Integration to target board
  **Note:**  Ensure that you have already downloaded the meta-aws repository source code from github and compile the aws-iot-c++ sdk on the yocto environment (steps are given in prerequisites section of this document)
  
 - push the aws-iot-c++ sdk compiled library to the target board. 
  ```
  $ adb push lib/  /data/aws-iot/
  ```
  - push the c++ target executable to the target board
  ```      
  $ adb push publish  /data/aws-iot/
  ```
         
## Execute the binary file in the target environment.
   - To start the application, run the below commands on the qcs610 board, And also select the command line option as given in the table for different video formats. To stop capturing press ctrl + c on the terminal board. Video will be stored or streamed as per given command line option.
  ```
    $ adb shell
   /# chmod +x /data/aws-iot/videoaws
   /# cd data/aws-iot/
  ```
  - To enable wifi connection
  ```
   /# wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c /etc/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf -ddddt &
   /# dhcpcd wlan0
 ```
 - To add data/aws-library to the library path 
 ```
    / # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/data/aws-iot/lib/
 ```
 - Execute the command
 ```
   /# ./videoaws  {video_format}  {output_path/ip}     {c++/python}
```


| Video format | cmdline-1 | cmdline-2 | cmdline-3 | 
|  :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4K Video | 4k | /data/4k.mp4 |  c++/python |
| Hd video | 1080p | /data/1080p.mp4 | c++/python |
| Tcp Streaming | tcp | 127.0.0.1 | c++/python |

**Example:** for playing 4k video
```
   /# ./videoaws 4k /data/video/4k.mp4 c++   
```
- Whenever the camera application starts and stops capturing, the application internally establishes connection to the aws-iot-core and publishes the current status of the camera details in json format to the particular topic. The details include recording format, device details and current action of the camera. The subscriber of this topic will receive the camera  details.  

## To Download video: 
 - Using the adb pull command we can download the video to the host system.
  ```  
    $ adb pull /data/4k.mp4
  ```
- To see the live streaming,  open the new terminal in the host system and enter below command also make sure you have installed the ‘vlc player’ on the host system  in order to view video playback.
 ```    
    $ adb forward tcp:8900 tcp:8900
    $ vlc -vvv tcp://127.0.0.1:8900
